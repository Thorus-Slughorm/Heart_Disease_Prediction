# I have done EDA , Data Preprocessing , Trained the model with 80% of data 
These are some parameters used in my data :

Observations from the above plot:
cp {Chest pain}: People with cp 1, 2, 3 are more likely to have heart disease than people with cp 0.

restecg {resting EKG results}: People with a value of 1 (reporting an abnormal heart rhythm, which can range from mild symptoms to severe problems) are more likely to have heart disease.

exang {exercise-induced angina}: people with a value of 0 (No ==> angina induced by exercise) have more heart disease than people with a value of 1 (Yes ==> angina induced by exercise)

slope {the slope of the ST segment of peak exercise}: People with a slope value of 2 (Downslopins: signs of an unhealthy heart) are more likely to have heart disease than people with a slope value of 2 slope is 0 (Upsloping: best heart rate with exercise) or 1 (Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)).

ca {number of major vessels (0-3) stained by fluoroscopy}: the more blood movement the better, so people with ca equal to 0 are more likely to have heart disease.

thal {thalium stress result}: People with a thal value of 2 (defect corrected: once was a defect but ok now) are more likely to have heart disease.
